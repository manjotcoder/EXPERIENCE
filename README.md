# EXPERIENCE 
<h1>My Experience in excel free course provided by GNDEC staff </h1>
<body>My name is Manjot Singh. Today, I want to share my experience with the Online Excel course offered by Great Learning Academy. This course has been very useful for me, and I gained a huge amount of knowledge from it. Microsoft Excel is used for organizing and calculating data in a spreadsheet. Through this course, I learned a lot of new things. Upon completion of the course, Great Learning Academy provides a valuable certificate.

I recommend every Excel user to familiarize themselves with basic functions such as summing cells (e.g., A1
), sorting, filtering, creating graphs, and many other functions that can be learned from this website (Great Learning Academy).</body>
